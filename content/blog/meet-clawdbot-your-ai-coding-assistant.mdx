# Meet Clawdbot: Your 24/7 AI Coding Assistant

Remember when I told you we built 02Ship by having conversations with Claude? Well, what if I told you there's a way to take that collaboration even further—to the point where Claude becomes a **fully autonomous coding partner** that can work on your projects 24/7?

Meet **Clawdbot** (also known as **Moltbot**)—the AI assistant that's changing how we build and ship products.

## What Is Clawdbot?

Clawdbot is an open-source automation platform that connects Claude to your entire development workflow. Think of it as giving Claude:

- **Hands:** It can read, write, and edit files directly
- **Eyes:** It can browse the web, search for solutions, and monitor your systems
- **Memory:** It remembers your preferences, past decisions, and project context
- **Tools:** It can run commands, manage GitHub, post to social media, and more
- **Persistence:** It keeps working even when you're not actively chatting

In short: Clawdbot turns Claude from a helpful chatbot into a **capable teammate**.

## Why This Matters for Your Projects

When you're building with Claude through the standard interface, you're limited to copy-pasting code back and forth. You ask for a feature, Claude gives you code, you paste it into your editor, test it, report back...

It works, but it's manual. Tedious. Slow.

With Clawdbot, this changes completely:

**Before (Standard Claude):**
- You: "Can you add a contact form to my website?"
- Claude: "Sure! Here's the code..."
- You: *copy-paste into editor, test, find bugs, report back*
- Repeat 5-10 times until it works

**After (With Clawdbot):**
- You: "Add a contact form to my website"
- Clawdbot: *reads your project, writes the form component, updates the routing, tests it locally, commits the changes*
- You: "Perfect! Ship it."
- Clawdbot: *deploys to production*

See the difference?

## Real-World Example: How We Use Clawdbot for 02Ship

Let me show you how Clawdbot helps us manage 02Ship itself.

### Morning Check-In
Every morning, Clawdbot:
- Checks for new issues or PRs on GitHub
- Scans our Discord for common questions
- Reviews site analytics for errors
- Summarizes everything in a brief report

### Content Updates
When we want to add a new lesson:
- I describe what I want in plain English
- Clawdbot creates the lesson JSON file with proper structure
- It adds the video metadata, timestamps, and description
- It updates the course index
- It commits the changes with a clear message
- It opens a PR for review

### Bug Fixes
When someone reports a bug:
- Clawdbot reads the issue
- Investigates the codebase
- Proposes a fix
- Tests it locally
- Creates a PR with the solution

**Total time:** Minutes instead of hours.

## The Skills System: Teaching Clawdbot New Tricks

Here's where it gets even better. Clawdbot has a **skills system**—modular capabilities you can add to expand what it can do.

Out of the box, Clawdbot knows how to:
- Read and write files
- Run shell commands
- Search the web
- Manage browser automation

But you can teach it **skills** like:

**GitHub Skill:**
- Create/review PRs
- Manage issues
- Track CI/CD pipelines
- Review code changes

**Twitter/X Skill:**
- Post updates
- Search mentions
- Engage with your community
- Schedule tweets

**Google Workspace Skill:**
- Manage emails
- Update calendars
- Create/edit documents
- Sync with Drive

**Notion Skill:**
- Create pages and databases
- Update project boards
- Archive completed work
- Generate reports

**Want a custom skill?** Clawdbot can help you build it. Seriously.

## Memory: The Game-Changer

Unlike standard chatbots that forget everything between sessions, Clawdbot has **persistent memory**.

It keeps track of:
- **Your preferences:** "I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript"
- **Project context:** "This repo uses Tailwind for styling"
- **Past decisions:** "We decided not to use that library because..."
- **Recurring patterns:** "Every Monday, check analytics and summarize trends"

This means you don't waste time re-explaining things. Clawdbot learns your workflow and adapts.

## Proactive Work: The Heartbeat System

Here's my favorite feature: **heartbeats**.

You can configure Clawdbot to periodically check on things and alert you only when something needs attention.

**Example heartbeat tasks:**
- "Check my inbox for urgent emails"
- "Monitor the production server for errors"
- "Scan GitHub for new issues tagged 'bug'"
- "Remind me if I haven't committed code in 3 days"

If everything's fine, Clawdbot stays quiet. If something needs action, it pings you.

It's like having a personal assistant who knows what matters.

## Multi-Channel: Work Where You Work

Clawdbot isn't locked to one interface. You can talk to it via:
- **Web chat** (browser-based)
- **Telegram** (mobile-friendly)
- **Discord** (community-integrated)
- **Slack** (team collaboration)
- **WhatsApp** (personal messaging)
- **iMessage** (if you're on Mac/iOS)

Start a conversation on your phone during your commute, continue it on your laptop at home—seamlessly.

## Security & Privacy

Before you ask: "Is it safe?"

**Yes.** Here's how:

1. **Local-first:** Clawdbot runs on YOUR machine, not some cloud server
2. **Your keys:** You provide your own Claude API key—no sharing, no middlemen
3. **Full control:** You approve what tools it can access
4. **Open source:** The code is public—no hidden behavior
5. **Private by default:** Memory files stay on your machine

You're in control. Always.
