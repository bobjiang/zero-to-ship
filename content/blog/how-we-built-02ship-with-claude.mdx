# How We Built 02Ship with Claude (Yes, Really!)

If you're reading this, you're standing inside a living example of what's possible when you combine a simple idea with AI tools. Let me tell you a story.

## It Started with a Simple Idea

A few weeks ago, I opened a blank document and wrote this:

> "This is a portal for everyone to learn AI (to build on your own idea). The goal is to use Claude code to build this product. This platform is a Claude learning platform built with Claude."

That's it. No detailed blueprints. No technical specifications. Just a clear vision: create a place where anyone—yes, *anyone*—could learn to build their ideas using AI, even without knowing how to code.

The irony? To prove it was possible, I needed to build the platform itself the same way.

## From Napkin Sketch to Real Platform

Here's what I knew I wanted:
- A welcoming landing page
- A blog (you're reading it!)
- Video courses people could follow step-by-step
- Links to our Discord community and discussion forum
- A way to easily add new courses as we created them

Here's what I *didn't* have:
- Months of development time
- A team of programmers
- A big budget

What I *did* have was Claude.

## The Build Journey: Conversations, Not Code

Instead of spending weeks learning to code, I spent a few days having conversations. With Claude.

**First conversation:** "I want to build a learning portal..." I described the vision, mentioned I wanted it simple and fast, and asked Claude to help me plan it out.

**Claude's response?** Questions. Good ones. "What kind of courses will you offer?" "How do you want to manage the content?" "Do you need user accounts right away?"

This back-and-forth helped me think through details I hadn't considered. Claude wasn't just writing code—it was helping me *design* the solution.

**Second conversation:** "Let's start building." Claude generated a complete project structure. Files appeared. A proper web framework (Next.js, if you're curious—but you don't need to be). Styling that actually looked professional. Navigation that worked.

**Third, fourth, fifth conversations:** Refinements. "Can we make the course pages show more detail?" "Let's add reflection questions for each lesson." "The colors need to match our brand better."

Each conversation took minutes. Each resulted in real, working changes.

## The Meta Moment

Here's where it gets interesting.

While building 02Ship, I realized: this *is* the story we need to tell. Not "look what I built," but "look what YOU can build."

So I did something unusual. I made the development of 02Ship itself the first real-world example in our Claude Basics course.

When you take Lesson 1, you'll see the actual requirements document I started with. You'll see the prompts I used. You'll see how an idea became this platform.

Why? Because the best way to learn is from real examples, not hypotheticals.

## What Changed Along the Way

**The name evolved:** We started as "Zero to Ship" and rebranded to "02Ship"—catchier, more memorable, and it represents going from 0 (nothing) to shipping something real.

**The courses deepened:** Our first course was basic. Too basic. We replaced it with a comprehensive 7-lesson curriculum that walks you through everything—from writing your first prompt to deploying your app.

**The platform itself improved:** Initially, we had simple course pages. Now? Learning objectives, multiple videos per lesson, hands-on exercises, reflection questions, and links to resources. The platform grew *as we learned what learners needed*.

**We got meta:** Remember when I said Lesson 1 uses 02Ship as the example? That wasn't the original plan. But once we realized how powerful it would be to show learners "the platform you're using was built this exact way," we restructured the entire first lesson around it.

## The Tech Stack (For the Curious)

You don't need to understand this to use 02Ship, but some of you will wonder: "What's under the hood?"

Here's the stack Claude helped us choose:
- **Next.js 14** for the web framework
- **TypeScript** for reliability
- **Tailwind CSS** for beautiful design
- **Vercel** for hosting (deploy in seconds)
- **GitHub** for version control
- **Discord** for community chat
- **GitHub Discussions** for our forum

Every decision was made through conversation. "What's the simplest tech for fast performance?" "What's easiest to maintain long-term?" "What won't break when we scale?"

Claude helped weigh the options. I made the final calls.

## What This Means for You

Here's the point of this story: **If I could build this platform by talking to Claude, you can build your idea too.**

You don't need to know what TypeScript is. You don't need to understand web frameworks. You need:
1. A clear idea of what you want to build
2. The ability to ask questions and refine your vision
3. Willingness to iterate (first versions are never perfect)

That's it.

## From Idea to Shipped in Weeks

The entire journey—from "I want to build a platform" to "it's live on the internet"—took weeks, not months.

Most of that time was spent thinking about what learners need, writing course content, and refining the experience. The actual building? That happened in conversations with Claude, in short bursts over a few days.

## What's Next for 02Ship

We're just getting started. Here's what's coming:

**More courses:** Claude Basics is lesson one. We're planning intermediate and advanced courses for those ready to level up.

**More lessons:** The Claude Basics course has 7 lessons planned. Right now, you can access Lesson 1. The rest are in production.

**Community features:** We want to showcase what learners build. Imagine a gallery of projects, all created by people who started with zero coding experience.

**Live cohorts:** Online learning is great. Learning together is better. We're exploring small-group cohorts where you build alongside others.

**Your ideas:** Seriously. Join our Discord. Tell us what you want to learn. This platform exists to help you ship *your* ideas, so we need to know what those are.

## The Invitation

You're not just reading about 02Ship's journey. You're standing at the start of your own.

What will you build? A tool to solve a problem you face every day? An app to help your community? A creative project you've been dreaming about?

Whatever it is, you can build it. The same way we built this.
