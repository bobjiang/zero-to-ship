It works locally but fails during build.\n\n**What I tried:**\n1. Checked package.json — all dependencies listed\n2. Ran `npm run build` locally — succeeds\n3. Cleared Vercel cache and redeployed — same error\n\n**Error message:**\n```\nError: Cannot find module '@/components/Header'\n```\n\n**Relevant code:**\n```typescript\n// app/page.tsx\nimport Header from '@/components/Header';\n```\n\n**Question:**\nIs this a case-sensitivity issue? My local file is `header.tsx` not `Header.tsx`. Does Vercel's Linux environment treat this differently?\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Specific, searchable title\n- Clear context (what, where, when)\n- Shows what you already tried\n- Includes actual error message\n- Provides relevant code\n- Proposes a hypothesis\n\nThis gets answered in minutes, not hours."

For the other 20%, lean on:\n- Official documentation\n- Human communities\n- Specialized tools\n- Your own judgment"

(people celebrate with you)\n- Metrics: 'Traffic doubled this week!'\n- Lessons: 'Learned that X doesn't work, trying Y instead'\n\n**Where to share:**\n- Twitter/X: Short updates, screenshots, metrics\n- LinkedIn: Professional angle, project milestones\n- Dev.to or Hashnode: Longer blog posts, tutorials\n- Discord/Slack communities: Daily check-ins\n- YouTube/Loom: Screen recordings of features\n\n**How often:**\n- Daily: Quick wins or progress notes (optional)\n- Weekly: Summary of what shipped\n- Monthly: Bigger reflections, metrics, roadmap\n\n**What NOT to share:**\n- Proprietary code or trade secrets\n- User data or private information\n- Unvalidated ideas you're protective of (unless you want feedback)\n\n**Example weekly update template:**\n\n🚀 Week 12 of building [Your Product]\n\nShipped:\n✅ Feature X\n✅ Bug fixes (list)\n\nLearned:\n💡 Lesson about [topic]\n\nNext week:\n🎯 Goal 1\n🎯 Goal 2\n\nLink: [yourproduct.com]\n\n#BuildInPublic #IndieHacker"
