Install VS Code\n2. Install Node.js\n3. Open VS Code terminal (View → Terminal)\n4. You're ready to run Claude's code!"

      "content": "**For Simple HTML Files:**\n1. Copy Claude's code\n2. Paste into a new file, save as `index.html`\n3. Double-click the file → opens in browser\n4. Done!\n\n**For Node.js/React Projects:**\n1. Copy all of Claude's code into appropriately named files\n2. Open terminal in the project folder\n3. Run: `npm install` (downloads dependencies)\n   - Wait for it to finish (can take 1-2 minutes)\n4. Run: `npm run dev` (or `npm start`, Claude will tell you)\n5. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`\n6. See your app running!\n\n**Making Changes:**\n1. Edit the file in VS Code\n2. Save (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S)\n3. Refresh browser (most modern setups auto-refresh)\n4. See changes immediately\n\n**If Something Breaks:**\n1. Check terminal for error messages\n2. Copy the full error\n3. Ask Claude: 'I got this error: [paste error]. How do I fix it?'\n4. Apply Claude's fix\n5. Try again\n\n**Pro tip:** Keep the terminal open while developing. Errors appear there first."

Read the error message fully\n2. Google '[error message] + [technology]' (e.g., 'module not found react')\n3. Ask Claude with full error text\n4.
