Import your project**\n- Click 'New Project'\n- Select your GitHub repo\n- Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings\n- Click 'Deploy'\n\n**4. Set environment variables (if needed)**\n- Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables\n- Add each variable from your .env.local\n- Redeploy after adding variables\n\n**5. Get your URL**\n- Vercel gives you: your-project.vercel.app\n- Visit it and test!\n\n**6.

In Namecheap:**\n- Go to Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS\n- Add these records (from Vercel):\n  - A Record: @ → 76.76.21.21\n  - CNAME: www → cname.vercel-dns.com\n- Save changes\n\n**4. Wait for DNS propagation**\n- Usually 5-30 minutes\n- Check status in Vercel dashboard\n- When green checkmark appears, you're live!\n\n**5. Set primary domain**\n- In Vercel, set myproject.com as primary\n- www.myproject.com will redirect automatically"
