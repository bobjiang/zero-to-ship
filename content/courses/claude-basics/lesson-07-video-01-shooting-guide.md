## Opening (0:00 - 1:30)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "You've made it. After six lessons of learning prompts, debugging, building pages, working with databases, and doing research with Claude -- you are here. Lesson 7. The capstone. This is where everything you've learned comes together, and by the end of these three videos, you will have planned, built, and shipped your very own MVP to the world. A real product. On the real internet. With real users. And here's the thing -- the platform you've been learning on this entire time? 02Ship? It was built exactly the way I'm about to teach you. So let's start with the plan."

**Keypoints:**
- Celebrate how far viewers have come (six full lessons completed)
- Establish the stakes: this is the capstone, the grand finale
- Connect back to 02Ship as living proof of the process
- Set the tone: energetic, celebratory, empowering
- Preview the three-video arc: plan, build, ship

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera with high energy and a big smile
- On-screen text: "Lesson 7: Build & Deploy Your MVP"
- Quick montage flashback of highlights from Lessons 1-6 (2-3 seconds each)
- Show the 02Ship platform briefly as the proof point

## Section 1: What Makes an MVP "Minimum" and "Viable"? (1:30 - 3:30)

### Defining MVP for Beginners

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's start with the most misunderstood term in the tech world: MVP. Minimum Viable Product. I need you to hear both of those words. Minimum means you're building the smallest possible version. Viable means it still has to work and deliver value. MVP does not mean 'broken.' It does not mean 'embarrassing.' It means focused. Focused on one core value that your users actually need."

**Keypoints:**
- MVP = Minimum Viable Product -- define both words clearly
- Minimum: smallest possible scope that delivers value
- Viable: it must actually work and solve a real problem
- MVP does NOT mean broken, low-quality, or embarrassing
- MVP DOES mean focused on one core value proposition

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Think about the first version of any product you love. Instagram started as a photo-sharing app with filters -- no Stories, no Reels, no shopping. Twitter was just short text posts. They shipped the smallest version that was still useful, got feedback, and grew from there. That's exactly what you're going to do."

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen text: "Minimum = Smallest scope | Viable = Still delivers value"
- Show a simple Venn diagram: "Minimum" circle overlapping with "Viable" circle, MVP in the center
- Brief examples of famous MVPs (Instagram, Twitter, Airbnb) shown as simple graphics

## Section 2: The One-Feature Rule (3:30 - 5:00)

### Can You Describe It in One Sentence?

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's the test I use for every MVP: can you describe it in one sentence? Not a paragraph. Not a pitch deck. One sentence. If you can't describe your MVP in a single sentence, it's too complex. You need to cut features until you can. Let me give you some examples."

**Keypoints:**
- The one-sentence test: if you cannot describe your MVP in one sentence, simplify it
- This forces you to identify the single most important thing your product does
- Everything else is a "nice to have" for version 2, 3, or 10
- If it's too complex to explain simply, it's too complex to build as a first project

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "02Ship in one sentence: 'A website where beginners watch video courses about building with AI.' That's it. Not 'a platform with user accounts, progress tracking, certificates, quizzes, a marketplace, and social features.' Those can come later. The one-sentence version is what you ship first."

**What to show on screen:**
- Good one-sentence examples:
  - "A website where beginners watch video courses about building with AI"
  - "A landing page that collects emails for my newsletter"
  - "A simple tool that converts recipes into shopping lists"
- Bad examples (too complex):
  - "A platform with courses, certificates, social features, marketplace, and AI tutoring" (crossed out)
- On-screen text: "If you can't say it in one sentence, it's too complex"

---

## Section 3: Choosing Your Tech Stack (5:00 - 7:00)

### Why Tech Stack Choice Matters Less Than You Think

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now, let's talk about your tech stack -- the technologies you'll use to build your MVP. And I'm going to say something that might surprise you: your tech stack choice matters way less than actually shipping. I've seen beginners spend weeks researching the 'perfect' tech stack and never build anything. Don't be that person. Pick something reasonable and go."

**Keypoints:**
- Tech stack = the set of tools and technologies used to build your product
- The best tech stack is one you can actually ship with
- Perfectionism about tech choices is a procrastination trap
- For beginners, simplicity beats performance optimization every time

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "That said, I do have a recommendation for beginners: Next.js deployed on Vercel. Why? Because it's what 02Ship is built with, so you've already seen it in action throughout this course. Vercel makes deployment incredibly simple -- often literally one click. And Next.js handles a lot of complexity for you. But if someone you trust recommends something different -- Astro, Remix, even plain HTML -- that's fine too. The technology that gets shipped beats the technology that stays on your hard drive."

**Keypoints:**
- Recommendation for beginners: Next.js + Vercel
- 02Ship uses this stack, so they've already seen it work
- Vercel handles deployment with minimal configuration
- Alternative stacks are perfectly valid -- what matters is shipping
- Tech stack choice matters less than shipping

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen comparison table: Next.js + Vercel (recommended), with brief notes on alternatives
- On-screen text: "The best tech stack is the one you ship with"
- Show the Vercel deployment dashboard briefly
- Keep this section practical, not theoretical

---

## Section 4: Timeline Reality Check (7:00 - 8:30)

### Your First MVP: 3-7 Days, Not Months

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's talk timeline. How long should your first MVP take? I want you to hear this clearly: three to seven days. Not three months. Not six months. Days. If you're spending more than a week on your first MVP, you're building too much. Remember, you have Claude. You have everything you've learned in this course. The bottleneck isn't coding speed -- it's decision-making speed. Decide what to build, open Claude, and start."

**Keypoints:**
- First MVP timeline: 3-7 days maximum
- If it's taking longer, you're building too much -- cut features
- Week 1 goal: working but imperfect
- The bottleneck is decisions, not code
- Claude dramatically accelerates the build process
- Your first MVP will look nothing like your final product -- and that is perfectly fine

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Here's the mindset shift: your first MVP will be nothing like your final product. And that's not just okay -- it's the whole point. You ship something small, get feedback from real people, and then improve it based on what they actually need, not what you imagined they might need. The 02Ship you're using today looks very different from the first version I deployed. But I couldn't have gotten here without shipping that rough first version."

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen timeline graphic: Day 1-2 (Plan), Day 3-5 (Build), Day 6-7 (Polish & Ship)
- On-screen text: "3-7 days, not months"
- Show a before/after of 02Ship (if available) -- early version vs. current version
- Emphasize the iterative nature with a simple cycle diagram

## Section 5: The MVP Planning Template (8:30 - 10:30)

### Problem, Solution, Features, Success Criteria

**SCRIPT:**
> "Alright, let's get practical. I have a planning template that you're going to fill out right now. It has four sections: Problem, Solution, three features maximum, and success criteria. Let me walk you through each one, and then I'll show you exactly how I filled it out for 02Ship."

#### Problem (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "First: what problem are you solving? Write it as a statement from your user's perspective. For 02Ship, it was: 'Non-programmers have great ideas but can't build them because they don't know how to code, and existing learn-to-code resources are too technical.'"

**Keypoints:**
- Write the problem from the user's perspective
- Be specific about who has this problem
- If you can't articulate the problem, you're not ready to build yet

#### Solution (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Second: what's your solution? One sentence. For 02Ship: 'A step-by-step video course that teaches non-programmers to build and ship using Claude.'"

**Keypoints:**
- One sentence describing how you solve the problem
- Should directly address the problem statement
- Keep it simple and clear

#### Three Features Maximum (1 minute)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Third: list your features. Maximum three. Yes, three. Not ten. Not twenty. Three. For 02Ship, my three features were: one, a course page with video lessons organized by topic; two, a landing page that explains what the platform is; three, a blog for additional tips and updates. That's it. No user accounts. No progress tracking. No certificates. Those can come in version 2. Three features. Ship it."

**Keypoints:**
- Hard limit: three features for your MVP
- Forces ruthless prioritization
- Everything else goes on a "future features" list
- Three features are enough to validate your idea with real users

#### Success Criteria (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Finally: how do you know your MVP worked? Write down two or three measurable things. For 02Ship: 'Five people complete at least one lesson and tell me it was helpful.' That's it. Simple, measurable, and focused on real users."

**Keypoints:**
- Keep success criteria simple and measurable
- Focus on user behavior, not vanity metrics
- Two to three criteria maximum
- This becomes your north star for what to build and what to skip

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the template as a clean, four-section card on screen
- Fill it in live as you explain each section
- On-screen text for the 02Ship example filled in completely
- Provide a downloadable template link in the description

## Section 6: Real Example -- Planning the 02Ship MVP (10:30 - 12:00)

### The Full Planning Template in Action

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me pull it all together. Here's the complete planning template I used for 02Ship. Problem: non-programmers can't build their ideas because existing resources are too technical. Solution: a step-by-step video course teaching non-programmers to build with Claude. Features: one, course pages with video lessons; two, a landing page; three, a blog. Success criteria: five people complete a lesson and find it helpful. One-sentence description: 'A website where beginners watch video courses about building with AI.' Tech stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vercel. Timeline: one week."

**Keypoints:**
- Walk through the complete, filled-in template
- Emphasize how simple and focused it is
- Point out what was deliberately excluded (user accounts, progress tracking, certificates)
- Connect each decision back to the principles covered earlier
- Remind viewers: this plan became the platform they're using right now

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Look at how simple that is. And yet it became this -- the platform you're learning on right now. That's the power of a focused MVP plan. You don't need a hundred features to create something valuable. You need three good ones, shipped to real people."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the complete filled-in template on screen
- Transition to showing the live 02Ship platform
- On-screen text: "This plan became this platform"
- Split screen: planning template on the left, live 02Ship on the right

## Closing (12:00 - 13:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's recap. An MVP is not broken -- it's focused. Use the one-sentence test to keep your scope in check. Pick a tech stack and go -- Next.js plus Vercel is a great choice for beginners. Give yourself three to seven days, not months. And use the planning template: problem, solution, three features, success criteria.
>
> Now here's your assignment: fill out the planning template for your own MVP. Use a real idea you have, or practice with the 02Ship example. Save it in your projects folder. Because in the next video, we're opening Claude and turning that plan into actual, working code. The building starts now.
>
> See you in Video 2!"

**Keypoints:**
- Quick recap of all five principles
- Give a clear assignment: fill out the planning template
- Tease the next video: turning the plan into real code with Claude
- Keep energy high -- they're about to build something real

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera (excited, encouraging)
- On-screen text: "Next: From Prompt to Production Code"
- Show the planning template one final time
- End card with links to the course page and Discord

**Essential messages to hit:**

1. **MVP means focused, not broken** (minimum scope, maximum value delivery)
2. **The one-sentence test** (if you can't describe it in one sentence, simplify)
3. **Tech stack choice matters less than shipping** (pick one and go)
4. **3-7 days, not months** (your first MVP should be fast)
5. **Three features maximum** (ruthless prioritization is a superpower)
6. **02Ship is the living proof** (planned and built exactly this way)
7. **Your first MVP will evolve** (ship imperfect, improve with feedback)

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- **Energetic and celebratory** (this is the capstone lesson -- they've earned this)
- **Practical and actionable** (every concept has a concrete exercise)
- **Empowering** (they're not just learning theory, they're about to build)
- **Direct and confident** (no hedging -- tell them exactly what to do)
- **Use 02Ship as proof** (meta-learning moment throughout)

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "My idea isn't good enough" → Your first MVP isn't your final product; ship it and learn
- "I don't know which tech stack to choose" → Use Next.js + Vercel; it's what this entire course was built on
- "Three features feels too few" → Three features shipped beats thirty features planned
- "A week isn't enough time" → With Claude, you'd be surprised how much you can build in a week
- "What if nobody uses it?" → Five real users giving feedback is worth more than months of perfecting alone

### Things to Avoid
- Making MVP sound like "low quality" (it's focused, not broken)
- Overwhelming with tech stack comparisons (recommend one, mention alternatives briefly)
- Being vague about timelines (be specific: 3-7 days)
- Encouraging perfection (the enemy of shipping)
- Skipping the planning template exercise (getting them to do it matters)
