**Target Duration:** 14 minutes
**Max Duration:** 15 minutes
**Target Audience:** Absolute beginners with no coding experience

---

## Opening (0:00 - 1:00)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "Ever sit down to brainstorm and stare at a blank page for twenty minutes? Maybe you come up with two or three ideas, then you're stuck. Your brain says 'that's all I've got.' Well, what if you had a brainstorming partner who never runs out of ideas? Who's available any time of day, never gets tired, never judges your suggestions, and can generate twenty ideas in thirty seconds? That's exactly what Claude is. In this video, I'm going to show you how to use Claude as a brainstorming engine -- not to replace your creativity, but to supercharge it."

**Keypoints:**
- Hook with the universal frustration: blank page, no ideas
- Reframe Claude as a brainstorming partner, not a replacement for creativity
- Promise: more ideas, better ideas, faster
- Set the tone: this video is fun and creative

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera (energized, playful energy for a creative topic)
- On-screen text: "Never Run Out of Ideas"
- Brief visual of a blank page transforming into a wall of sticky notes

## Section 1: Solo Brainstorming vs. Claude-Assisted (1:00 - 2:30)

### Why Brainstorming Alone Has Limits

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me ask you something: when you brainstorm alone, how many ideas do you usually come up with? Three? Five? Maybe ten if you're having a great day? There's nothing wrong with that -- our brains naturally gravitate toward a few familiar patterns. We tend to think of ideas similar to things we've seen before. Psychologists call this 'functional fixedness' -- we get stuck in one way of thinking."

**Keypoints:**
- Solo brainstorming typically produces 3-10 ideas
- Our brains favor familiar patterns (functional fixedness)
- We self-censor: "that's a dumb idea" kills creativity before it starts
- Solo brainstorming lacks the push-back and building-on that group brainstorming provides

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Claude changes the equation. It doesn't have the same cognitive biases you do. It draws from a huge range of patterns across industries, domains, and problem types. So when you brainstorm with Claude, you get ideas you would never have thought of on your own. Not because you're not creative -- but because two perspectives are always better than one."

**Keypoints:**
- Claude brings a different perspective, not a better one
- It draws from patterns across many industries and domains
- Two perspectives beat one -- always
- Your creativity plus Claude's range equals better output

**Visual suggestions:**
- Simple graphic: solo brainstorm (3-5 sticky notes) vs. Claude-assisted (20+ sticky notes)
- On-screen text: "Your Creativity + Claude's Range = Better Ideas"
- Keep the visual playful and energetic

---

## Section 2: Divergent Thinking -- Generating Quantity (2:30 - 4:30)

### More Ideas = Better Ideas

**SCRIPT:**
> "The first phase of any good brainstorm is what's called divergent thinking. That just means: generate as many ideas as possible without judging them. Quantity first, quality later. This is where Claude absolutely shines."

#### The Quantity Prompt (1:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's how I do it. I tell Claude: 'Generate 20 feature ideas for a learning platform that teaches non-programmers to build apps with AI. Don't filter or evaluate -- just generate as many as possible.' Twenty ideas. Not three. Not five. Twenty. Why twenty? Because the first five ideas are always obvious. Everyone thinks of those. Ideas six through fifteen start getting interesting. And ideas sixteen through twenty? Those are often the most creative, because Claude has to stretch beyond the obvious."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask for a high number: 20 or more ideas
- First 5 ideas are obvious (everyone thinks of those)
- Ideas 6-15 get interesting
- Ideas 16-20 are often the most creative (Claude stretches beyond the obvious)
- Explicitly say "don't filter or evaluate" -- you want raw quantity

**What to show on screen:**
- The prompt on screen: "Generate 20 feature ideas for [product]. Don't filter or evaluate -- just generate."
- On-screen text: "Ideas 16-20 are often the best ones"

#### Adding Variety (1:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Want even more variety? Try adding categories. Tell Claude: 'Generate 20 feature ideas, split into groups: five for engagement, five for learning outcomes, five for community, and five wild cards that don't fit any category.' The wild cards are where the surprises live. When I was brainstorming features for 02Ship, one of the wild card ideas was 'a prompt library where learners can browse and reuse successful prompts from other students.' That became one of the features I'm most excited about building."

**Keypoints:**
- Use categories to force variety: engagement, learning, community, wild cards
- Wild card category produces the most unexpected ideas
- Use 02Ship as a concrete example of this technique in action
- Categories prevent Claude from clustering around one type of idea

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the categorized prompt on screen
- Highlight the "wild card" category with a different color or icon
- On-screen text: "Wild Cards = Where Surprises Live"

---

## Section 3: Convergent Thinking -- Evaluating and Narrowing Down (4:30 - 6:30)

### From 20 Ideas to the Best 3

**SCRIPT:**
> "You've got twenty ideas on the table. Now what? This is phase two: convergent thinking. That means evaluating and narrowing down. And yes, Claude can help with this too -- but this is where your judgment matters most."

#### Evaluation Criteria (1:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "First, decide what criteria matter to you. For a beginner building their first product, I'd suggest three: impact -- how much will this help users? Effort -- how hard is this to build? And uniqueness -- does this set your product apart? Tell Claude: 'Evaluate each of these 20 ideas on three criteria: user impact, effort to build, and uniqueness. Rate each on a scale of 1 to 5 and identify the top 5.'"

**Keypoints:**
- Choose 2-3 evaluation criteria that matter for your product
- Suggested criteria: impact, effort, uniqueness
- Ask Claude to rate each idea on a simple scale
- Have Claude identify the top 5 for you to consider

**What to show on screen:**
- The evaluation prompt
- Show a sample output: a table with ideas rated on each criterion
- On-screen text: "Impact x Effort x Uniqueness"

#### Your Judgment Is the Final Filter (1:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now here's the critical part: Claude's evaluation is a starting point, not the final answer. You know things Claude doesn't -- your users, your resources, your vision, what excites you. Look at Claude's top five and ask yourself: 'Which of these am I most excited about? Which ones align with what I know about my users? Which ones can I actually build with my current skills?' That's how you get from twenty ideas to the best three."

**Keypoints:**
- Claude's evaluation is a starting point, not a verdict
- You add context Claude doesn't have: user knowledge, personal resources, excitement
- Excitement matters -- you'll work harder on ideas you care about
- Final decision is always yours

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the narrowing process visually: 20 ideas, arrow to top 5 (Claude's picks), arrow to top 3 (your picks)
- On-screen text: "Claude suggests. You decide."

## Section 4: Advanced Brainstorming Techniques (6:30 - 8:30)

### Four Techniques That Unlock Better Ideas

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me share four brainstorming techniques that make Claude even more powerful. These aren't complicated -- they're just different angles you can take."

#### Technique 1: Role-Playing (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "First: role-playing. Tell Claude to brainstorm as a specific person. 'Brainstorm five features from the perspective of a frustrated beginner who keeps getting stuck.' Or: 'What would a marketing expert say is missing from this product?' Different perspectives produce different ideas. You can have Claude play the skeptic, the cheerleader, the expert, or the customer."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask Claude to adopt different perspectives: beginner, expert, skeptic, customer
- Each role produces a different type of insight
- Great for uncovering blind spots in your thinking
- Example roles: frustrated user, marketing expert, competitor, investor

#### Technique 2: Constraints-Based Brainstorming (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Second: constraints-based brainstorming. Instead of removing constraints, add them. 'Generate ten feature ideas that cost zero dollars to build.' Or: 'What features could I add in one weekend?' Constraints force creativity. When you can't do the obvious thing, you find clever alternatives."

**Keypoints:**
- Add constraints: budget limits, time limits, technology limits
- Constraints spark creativity by forcing unconventional thinking
- Examples: "features that cost $0," "features buildable in one weekend"
- Some of the best product ideas come from working within limits

#### Technique 3: The Worst Ideas Technique (1:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Third -- and this is my favorite -- the 'worst ideas' technique. Tell Claude: 'Generate the ten worst feature ideas for a learning platform. Ideas that would definitely fail or annoy users.' Then ask: 'Now explain what makes each idea bad. Finally, invert each one into a good idea.' This sounds silly, but it works brilliantly. A terrible idea like 'make lessons two hours long with no breaks' inverts into 'keep lessons short and include regular checkpoints.' A bad idea like 'hide all navigation' inverts into 'make navigation dead simple and always visible.' Bad ideas, when flipped, reveal what users actually need."

**Keypoints:**
- Generate deliberately bad ideas first
- Analyze why they're bad
- Invert each bad idea into a good one
- The inversion reveals what users truly need
- This technique breaks you out of conventional thinking

#### Technique 4: Combination Brainstorming (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Fourth: combination brainstorming. Take two or three ideas from your list and ask Claude: 'How could I combine these three ideas into one feature?' Sometimes two okay ideas combine into one great idea. For 02Ship, the idea of 'video lessons' combined with 'written notes' became the lesson format you see now: video at the top, detailed text content below. Neither alone was as good as both together."

**Keypoints:**
- Take two or three ideas and ask Claude to combine them
- Combinations often produce something better than either idea alone
- Use the 02Ship lesson format as a real example
- This is how good product design happens -- synthesizing multiple inputs

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show each technique as a numbered card on screen
- Highlight the "worst ideas" technique as a fan favorite
- On-screen text for each technique name
- Keep the energy playful -- brainstorming should feel fun, not like homework

## Section 5: Live Demo -- Brainstorming Features and Picking the Best 3 (8:30 - 12:30)

### Real-Time Brainstorming Session

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's do this live. I'm going to brainstorm features for 02Ship using Claude, and by the end, we'll have picked the three best ones. Watch how the process works from start to finish."

#### Step 1: Divergent Phase -- Generate 20 Ideas (8:30 - 9:30)

**SCRIPT:**
> "I'll start with the quantity prompt: 'I'm building 02Ship, a learning platform that teaches non-programmers to build apps using AI tools like Claude. Generate 20 feature ideas that would make this platform more valuable to absolute beginners. Don't filter -- give me everything, including weird ideas.'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Open Claude interface
- Type the prompt naturally
- Show Claude generating the list of 20 ideas
- Read through several ideas aloud, reacting naturally
- Point out a few surprising ones: "I wouldn't have thought of that"

#### Step 2: Add the Wild Cards (9:30 - 10:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Good list, but I want more variety. Let me ask: 'Now give me five wild card feature ideas -- things that no other learning platform does. Be unconventional.'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the wild card prompt
- Show Claude's unconventional suggestions
- React with genuine interest: "Okay, that's actually creative"
- Pick out one or two that spark excitement

#### Step 3: The Worst Ideas Flip (10:00 - 10:45)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's try the worst ideas technique: 'Generate the five worst feature ideas for a learning platform -- things that would make learners quit immediately. Then invert each one into a great feature.'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the worst ideas prompt
- Show Claude's deliberately terrible ideas (should be funny/relatable)
- Show the inversions appearing
- Highlight one particularly good inversion: "See how the bad idea revealed something important?"

#### Step 4: Evaluate and Narrow Down (10:45 - 11:45)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now I've got about 30 ideas total. Let me have Claude help narrow them down: 'From all the ideas above, evaluate the top 10 based on: user impact for beginners, ease of building with Claude Code, and uniqueness compared to other learning platforms. Rate each 1-5 and show me a table.'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the evaluation prompt
- Show Claude's rating table
- Walk through the top-rated ideas
- Point out where you agree and disagree with Claude's ratings

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Claude rated these highly, and I mostly agree. But look -- it rated this idea higher than I would. I know from talking to our community in Discord that this isn't actually what learners want right now. So I'm going to swap it out for this one, which Claude rated lower but which I know our users are asking for. This is exactly what I mean by 'Claude suggests, you decide.'"

#### Step 5: Pick the Final 3 (11:45 - 12:30)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Alright, here are my final three features, combining Claude's analysis with what I know about our learners."

**What to show on screen:**
- Display the final three features clearly
- Briefly explain why each one made the cut
- Show the logic: Claude's data plus your judgment

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "We started with a blank page. In about fifteen minutes, we generated thirty ideas, evaluated them on three criteria, and narrowed down to three high-impact features that are buildable and unique. This is what Claude-assisted brainstorming looks like in practice."

**Keypoints:**
- Emphasize the journey: blank page to three actionable features
- Show that the process is fast but thoughtful
- Reinforce that human judgment was the final filter
- Keep the energy celebratory -- this is a win

**Visual suggestions:**
- Full-screen Claude interface throughout the demo
- Natural pacing -- do not rush through the ideas
- React genuinely to surprising or creative ideas
- Show the final three features on screen as a clear summary at the end

## Section 6: Your Job in the Process (12:30 - 13:00)

### Evaluate, Combine, Refine

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me be clear about your role in all of this. Claude generates the raw material. Your job is to evaluate, combine, and refine. Claude doesn't know your users the way you do. It doesn't know your budget, your timeline, or what gets you excited to work on a Saturday morning. You bring the judgment, the context, and the taste. Claude brings the volume and the variety. Together? You're unstoppable."

**Keypoints:**
- Claude generates raw material (quantity and variety)
- You evaluate (using your judgment and context)
- You combine (merging good ideas into great ones)
- You refine (shaping ideas to fit your reality)
- The human-AI partnership is the real superpower

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen text: "Claude generates. You decide."
- Simple visual: Claude's output flowing through your filter into final ideas

## Closing (13:00 - 14:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's wrap up what you've learned. You now know the two phases of brainstorming: divergent thinking to generate quantity, then convergent thinking to evaluate and narrow down. You've got four advanced techniques: role-playing, constraints, the worst ideas flip, and combination brainstorming. And you saw the whole process live -- from blank page to three specific features in under fifteen minutes.
>
> Here's the takeaway I want you to remember: Claude is a tireless brainstorming partner. It never runs out of ideas, it never judges yours, and it's available whenever inspiration strikes.
>
> This wraps up Lesson 6 -- Analysis and Research with Claude. You've learned to do research, analyze data, and brainstorm ideas. These are real professional skills that product managers, founders, and strategists use every day. And now you can do them too.

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- Playful and energetic -- brainstorming should feel fun, not like work
- Encouraging and collaborative -- Claude is a partner, not a crutch
- Show genuine excitement during the live demo when good ideas emerge
- Use 02Ship examples throughout to keep things concrete and real

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "I'm not a creative person" --> Creativity is a process, not a personality trait. The techniques in this video work for everyone
- "What if all the ideas are bad?" --> That's impossible when you generate 20+. The worst ideas technique proves that even bad ideas have value
- "How do I know which ideas to pick?" --> Use evaluation criteria plus your own judgment. There's no single right answer -- trust your instincts
- "Can Claude really brainstorm?" --> It generates ideas across domains and perspectives you'd never access alone. It's one of its strongest capabilities

### Things to Avoid
- Making brainstorming sound serious or academic (it should feel playful)
- Implying Claude is more creative than the viewer (Claude generates volume; you bring taste and judgment)
- Skipping the evaluation phase (generating ideas without narrowing down is not useful)
- Rushing through the worst ideas technique (it's the most fun part -- let it breathe)
- Forgetting to show the human judgment step (Claude rates, but you decide)
