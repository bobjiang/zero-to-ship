What are the common themes? Where do sources disagree? What's missing?'\n\nClaude connects the dots across sources.\n\n**Phase 4: Extract Insights**\nPrompt: 'Based on this research, what are the top 3 insights for someone building [your product]? What should I do next?'\n\nClaude gives you actionable takeaways.\n\n**Example: Researching AI Coding Tools Market**\n\n1. Gather: Articles on GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit Agent, market size\n2. Summarize: 'Summarize each article's key points about user adoption and pricing'\n3. Synthesize: 'What do these sources tell us about the AI coding tools market in 2024?'\n4. Insights: 'Based on this, what differentiation strategy should a new AI coding tool use?'\n\nResult: Actionable market insights in 15 minutes."

Compare on: pricing, key features, target audience, strengths, weaknesses. Format as markdown table.'\n\nClaude builds the table (you fill in 'My Product' column).\n\n**Step 3: Find Gaps**\nPrompt: 'Based on this comparison, what gaps exist in the market? What are these competitors NOT doing that users might want?'\n\nClaude identifies opportunities.\n\n**Step 4: Positioning**\nPrompt: 'Given this competitive landscape, how should I position my product to stand out? Give me 3 positioning strategies with pros/cons.'\n\nClaude suggests differentiation angles.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n| Feature | Competitor A | Competitor B | My Product |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Price | $29/mo | Free + $49 Pro | $19/mo |\n| Key Feature | AI chat | Code completion | Full projects |\n| Target | Developers | Students | Non-coders |\n| Strength | Speed | Free tier | Ease of use |\n| Weakness | Expensive | Limited | New/unproven |\n\n**Gaps:** No tool focuses on non-coders specifically. Most assume coding knowledge.\n\n**Positioning:** 'The only AI coding tool designed for people who don't code.'"
