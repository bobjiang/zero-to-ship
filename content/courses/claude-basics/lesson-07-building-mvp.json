[Be specific: 'non-technical founders', not 'everyone']\n- How do they solve it today? [What's the alternative?]\n- Why is that solution insufficient? [The pain point]\n\n**The Solution (Your MVP):**\n- Core value proposition: [The ONE thing your MVP does really well]\n- How it works: [3-5 sentence explanation a 10-year-old could understand]\n\n**Key Features (3 Maximum):**\n1. [Feature 1 - the absolute minimum to deliver value]\n2. [Feature 2 - necessary for feature 1 to work]\n3. [Feature 3 - nice to have if time permits]\n\n**NOT in the MVP (Save for V2):**\n- [Feature you want but don't strictly need]\n- [Polish that can wait]\n- [Integration that's not critical]\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Technical: [App runs, core flow works, no critical bugs]\n- User: [Can complete main task without confusion]\n- Metric: [Get X users to complete Y action]\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Frontend: [e.g., Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind]\n- Backend: [e.g., Supabase, or none (static site)]\n- Deployment: [e.g., Vercel]\n- Other: [Any critical integrations]\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Planning: [1 day]\n- Building: [3-5 days]\n- Testing & polish: [1-2 days]\n- Launch: [1 day]\n- **Total: 1 week maximum for first MVP**\n\n**Known Risks:**\n- [Technical challenge you're unsure about]\n- [Assumption that might be wrong]\n- [Resource you might not have]\n\n---\n\n**After filling this out, ask yourself:**\n1. Could I explain this to someone in 30 seconds?\n2. Can I build this in a week without burning out?\n3. Would even 10 people find this useful?\n\nIf all yes → start building. If any no → simplify further."

      "title": "Recommended Tech Stack for First MVP",
      "content": "**Best for Absolute Beginners:**\n\n**Option 1: Static Website**\n- HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript\n- Deployment: Netlify (drag & drop)\n- Best for: Landing pages, portfolios, simple tools\n- Pros: Simplest possible, no build process\n- Cons: Limited functionality, harder to scale\n\n**Option 2: Next.js + Vercel (Recommended)**\n- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS\n- Deployment: Vercel (GitHub integration)\n- Best for: Most web apps, SaaS products, content sites\n- Pros: Claude knows it well, scales to complex apps, great docs\n- Cons: Steeper learning curve than plain HTML\n\n**Option 3: No-Code Tools**\n- Webflow, Framer, Carrd (for landing pages)\n- Bubble, FlutterFlow (for apps)\n- Best for: Maximum speed, no coding at all\n- Pros: Ship even faster, visual editing\n- Cons: Less control, harder to customize, costs add up\n\n**What NOT to Choose for First MVP:**\n❌ Custom backend from scratch (use Supabase/Firebase instead)\n❌ Mobile app (web first, mobile later)\n❌ Blockchain/crypto integrations (complexity nightmare)\n❌ Microservices architecture (you're not Netflix)\n❌ Cutting-edge frameworks (stick to what Claude knows)\n\n**Our Recommendation:**\nNext.js + Vercel. Why?\n- Claude has excellent Next.js knowledge\n- Free hosting on Vercel\n- Scales from simple to complex\n- Huge community for help\n- Used by professionals (you're learning a real skill)\n\n**If Next.js feels too complex:**\nStart with plain HTML/CSS, ship that, then rebuild in Next.js for V2. Shipping imperfectly > not shipping perfectly."

      "content": "**Day 1: Planning & Setup**\n\n1. Fill out MVP Planning Template\n2. Create a Project in Claude with your plan as custom instructions\n3. Ask Claude: 'Review my MVP plan and suggest improvements'\n4. Refine based on feedback\n5. Create GitHub repo (optional but recommended)\n6. Set up local dev environment (Lesson 4)\n\n**Day 2-3: Core Features**\n\n1. Prompt Claude: 'Generate the initial project structure for [MVP]'\n2. Run code locally, verify it works\n3. For each core feature:\n   - Prompt: 'Add [feature]: [specific requirements]'\n   - Test the feature\n   - Iterate if needed (simplify, expand, debug)\n4. Commit working code after each feature\n\n**Day 4: Polish & Test**\n\n1. Mobile responsiveness check (test on phone)\n2. Add error handling ('what if user does X wrong?')\n3. Basic loading states (spinners, skeletons)\n4. Accessibility check (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels)\n5. Copy/content review (fix typos, improve clarity)\n6. Ask 1-2 people to test and give feedback\n\n**Day 5: Deployment Prep**\n\n1. Add basic analytics (Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics)\n2. Set up error tracking (optional: Sentry free tier)\n3. Add meta tags for SEO and social sharing\n4. Create README with setup instructions\n5. Final test: does it work in production mode? (`npm run build && npm start`)\n\n**Day 6: Deploy & Launch**\n\n1. Deploy to Vercel (connect GitHub repo)\n2. Set up custom domain (optional)\n3. Test live site on multiple devices\n4. Fix any production bugs\n5. Write launch post (Twitter, LinkedIn, relevant communities)\n6. Share with 5-10 people directly for initial feedback\n\n**Day 7: Respond & Plan**\n\n1. Respond to all feedback\n2. Log bugs and feature requests\n3. Prioritize what to fix vs. what to defer\n4. Plan V1.1 improvements\n5. Celebrate: you shipped! 🎉\n\n**If You Get Stuck:**\n- Stuck <30 min: Debug with Claude\n- Stuck 30-60 min: Ask in Discord/community\n- Stuck 60+ min: Simplify the feature or skip it for V2\n- Really stuck: Take a break, come back fresh\n\nRemember: Done is better than perfect."
