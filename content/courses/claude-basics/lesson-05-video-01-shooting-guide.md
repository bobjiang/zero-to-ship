# Video 1 Shooting Guide: Why Projects Matter: Solving the Context Problem

**Target Duration:** 11 minutes
**Max Duration:** 15 minutes
**Target Audience:** Absolute beginners with no coding experience

---

## Opening (0:00 - 1:00)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "Have you ever had to explain the same thing over and over again to someone? Imagine hiring a contractor to renovate your house, and every single morning they show up, they've forgotten everything: the floor plan, the paint colors, what rooms you've already finished. That's what it feels like to build a project with Claude without using Projects. Every new conversation, you start from zero. Today, I'm going to show you how to fix that problem permanently."

**Keypoints:**
- Open with a relatable frustration: repeating yourself
- Use the contractor analogy to make the pain point vivid
- Promise a permanent solution: Claude Projects
- Set up the stakes: this feature saves hours of work

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera (slightly exasperated expression, then brightening)
- On-screen text: "The Context Problem"
- Brief flash of a Claude conversation where context is being re-explained

---

## Section 1: The Context Problem (1:00 - 3:00)

### Why Starting from Zero Hurts

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me show you what I mean by 'the context problem.' In a regular Claude conversation, every chat is a blank slate. Claude doesn't remember what you talked about yesterday. It doesn't know your tech stack, your project goals, your coding style, or what features you've already built. So what happens? You end up pasting the same information at the top of every single conversation."

**Keypoints:**
- Each regular Claude conversation starts fresh with no memory
- Claude has no idea what your project is about unless you tell it every time
- Beginners waste enormous time re-explaining context
- The longer your project gets, the worse this problem becomes

**What to show on screen:**
- Open a new Claude conversation
- Type a prompt like "Add a contact form to my website" and show how Claude asks basic questions about your tech stack
- Show the frustration of having to explain everything from scratch
- On-screen text: "Every new chat = blank slate"

### The Copy-Paste Workaround

**SCRIPT:**
> "Some people try to work around this by keeping a text file with their project details and pasting it at the start of every conversation. I actually did this myself early on with 02Ship. I had a document with my tech stack, my project structure, my design preferences, all of it. And every time I started a new Claude chat, I'd paste the whole thing in. It worked, sort of. But it was tedious, error-prone, and I kept forgetting to update it."

**Keypoints:**
- The manual workaround: copy-paste context every time
- It works, but it is clunky and unreliable
- You forget to update it when things change
- There is a better way: Projects

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show a text document with project context (your actual CLAUDE.md or similar)
- Demonstrate pasting it into a new chat
- On-screen text: "The copy-paste workaround: tedious but common"

## Section 2: What Projects Are (3:00 - 5:30)

### Projects = Workspaces with Memory

**SCRIPT:**
> "So what are Projects? Think of a Project as a dedicated office for your app. When you walk into your office, everything is already there: your notes on the wall, your reference documents on the desk, your tools laid out exactly how you left them. You don't have to set anything up. You just sit down and start working. That's what a Claude Project does for your conversations."

**Keypoints:**
- Projects are persistent workspaces inside Claude
- They remember your custom instructions permanently
- They hold a knowledge base of uploaded documents
- Every conversation inside a Project automatically has access to all of this context

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show a simple diagram: regular chat (empty room) vs. Project (furnished office)
- On-screen text: "Projects = dedicated workspaces with memory"

### Key Features Overview

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me walk you through the three key features that make Projects powerful. First, custom instructions. These are permanent notes you write for Claude that apply to every conversation in the Project. Things like your tech stack, your coding style, your project goals. Second, the knowledge base. You can upload files: your README, your requirements document, code samples, design mockups, anything Claude needs to reference. And third, conversation history. All your chats within a Project are organized together, so you can reference previous work."

**Keypoints:**
- Feature 1: Custom instructions (permanent context that applies to every chat)
- Feature 2: Knowledge base (uploaded files Claude can reference)
- Feature 3: Conversation history (organized chats within the Project)
- All three work together to eliminate context-setting overhead

**What to show on screen:**
- Briefly show each feature in the Claude interface (if possible, show the Projects panel)
- On-screen text listing the three features as bullet points
- Use icons or simple graphics for each feature

## Section 3: Projects vs. Regular Chats (5:30 - 7:00)

### When to Use Each

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now, Projects don't replace regular chats. They serve different purposes. Think of it this way: a regular chat is like a sticky note. Quick, disposable, good for one-off questions. 'What does this error mean?' 'How do I center a div?' Questions that don't need ongoing context. A Project is like a filing cabinet. It's for sustained, multi-session work on a specific product or goal."

**Keypoints:**
- Regular chats: quick questions, one-off tasks, exploring ideas
- Projects: sustained work on a specific product, multi-day builds, anything that needs persistent context
- You can have multiple Projects for different apps or goals
- Use regular chats for general Claude questions unrelated to your project

**Visual suggestions:**
- Side-by-side comparison: sticky note vs. filing cabinet
- On-screen text: "Quick questions = regular chat / Ongoing builds = Project"
- Show examples of each use case

### A Quick Note on Claude Pro

**SCRIPT:**
> "I want to be upfront about something: Projects is a Claude Pro feature. That means it requires a paid subscription, which is currently $20 per month. I know that might be a concern, and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was genuinely worth it. For building real products, Projects saves you so much time and frustration that it pays for itself quickly. That said, everything else in this course works with the free plan. Projects is the one feature where I strongly recommend the upgrade."

**Keypoints:**
- Projects requires Claude Pro ($20/month)
- Be honest and upfront about the cost
- Frame it positively: the time savings justify the cost
- Reassure viewers: rest of the course works on the free plan
- They can try free plan first and upgrade when ready

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen text: "Claude Pro: $20/month"
- Brief mention, do not dwell on pricing
- On-screen text: "Worth it for serious project work"

## Section 4: Real Example: Building With and Without Projects (7:00 - 10:00)

### Without Projects: The Old Way

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me show you the difference with a real example from building 02Ship. Before I started using Projects, here's what my workflow looked like. I'd open a new Claude chat and type something like: 'I'm building a learning portal called 02Ship using Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The site has a landing page, a courses section with video lessons, a blog using MDX, and community links. I'm deploying on Vercel. Can you help me add a search feature to the blog?' That's a lot of context just to ask one question."

**Keypoints:**
- Show a realistic before scenario
- Highlight how much text goes into re-establishing context
- Emphasize the repetitiveness across multiple conversations
- This gets worse as your project grows in complexity

**What to show on screen:**
- Type out or show the long context-setting prompt
- Highlight how much of it is repeated boilerplate
- On-screen text: "Same context, every single time"

### With Projects: The New Way

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now here's the same workflow with Projects. I've already set up my 02Ship Project with custom instructions describing my tech stack, my file structure, and my coding conventions. I've uploaded my README, my course data files, and my component structure. So when I start a new conversation inside the Project, I just type: 'Add a search feature to the blog.' That's it. Five words. Claude already knows everything else."

**Keypoints:**
- Same task, dramatically less effort
- Custom instructions handle the permanent context
- Uploaded files give Claude deep knowledge of the project
- The conversation can focus on what matters: the actual task

**What to show on screen:**
- Show the short, clean prompt inside a Project
- Contrast it visually with the long prompt from the previous section
- Show Claude's response demonstrating it already understands the project context
- On-screen text: "5 words vs. 5 paragraphs"

### The Time Savings

**SCRIPT:**
> "I estimated that before using Projects, I spent about 5 to 10 minutes per conversation just setting context. With 02Ship, I had dozens of conversations over several weeks. That's hours of copy-pasting and re-explaining. With Projects, that overhead drops to near zero. You just open a conversation and start building."

**Keypoints:**
- 5-10 minutes of context-setting per conversation without Projects
- Over dozens of conversations, this adds up to hours
- Projects eliminates roughly 90% of context-setting overhead
- More time building, less time explaining

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show a simple time comparison graphic
- On-screen text: "90% less context-setting"
- Keep the comparison clear and visual

## Closing (10:00 - 11:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's recap. Without Projects, every Claude conversation starts from zero, and you waste time re-explaining your project over and over. With Projects, you set up your context once, and it persists across every conversation. Projects give you three powerful features: custom instructions, a knowledge base, and organized conversation history. They require Claude Pro, but the time savings make it well worth the investment.
>
> In the next video, I'm going to walk you through setting up your own Project step by step. You'll write your custom instructions, upload your knowledge files, and test that Claude actually understands your project. It's hands-on and practical, and by the end, you'll have a fully configured workspace ready for serious building.
>
> See you in Video 2!"

**Keypoints:**
- Recap the context problem and how Projects solve it
- Restate the three key features
- Acknowledge the Pro requirement honestly
- Build excitement for the hands-on setup in Video 2

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show your face (confident, encouraging)
- On-screen text: "Next: Setting Up Your Project"
- End card with link to Video 2

## Key Talking Points Summary

**Essential messages to hit:**

1. **Without Projects, you start from zero every time** (the fundamental pain point)
2. **Projects are dedicated workspaces with persistent memory** (the core concept)
3. **Three key features: custom instructions, knowledge base, conversation history** (what makes it work)
4. **Regular chats for quick questions, Projects for sustained building** (when to use each)
5. **Claude Pro is required but worth it for real project work** (honest and positive framing)
6. **Projects save hours of context-setting over the life of a build** (concrete benefit)

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- **Relatable and empathetic** (acknowledge the frustration of repeating context)
- **Practical and concrete** (use the 02Ship example throughout)
- **Honest about costs** (don't hide the Pro requirement, but frame it positively)
- **Analogies are key** (office/workspace, contractor, sticky note vs. filing cabinet)

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "Do I have to pay for Claude Pro?" → Yes for Projects, but the time savings justify it; rest of the course works on the free plan
- "What if I can't afford Pro right now?" → You can start building with regular chats and upgrade when you're ready for multi-session work
- "Is the context problem really that bad?" → It gets worse as your project grows; Projects prevent it from becoming a bottleneck
- "Can I have multiple Projects?" → Yes, one per app or goal is a great approach

### Things to Avoid
- Making the free plan seem inadequate (it works for many tasks)
- Spending too long on pricing details (mention it, move on)
- Being overly technical about how Projects work internally
- Skipping the before/after comparison (it is the most persuasive part of the video)
