**Target Duration:** 14 minutes
**Max Duration:** 15 minutes
**Target Audience:** Absolute beginners with no coding experience

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:45)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "In the last video, you learned that iteration is how you get great results from Claude. But here's the question: what do you actually say in your follow-up? What words do you use? That's what this video is about. I'm going to give you eight specific techniques, eight follow-up moves you can use any time Claude's response needs work. Think of these as your refinement toolkit. By the end of this video, you'll never stare at a Claude response and think 'This isn't quite right, but I don't know how to fix it.' You'll know exactly what to say."

**Keypoints:**
- Connect directly to Video 1: you know WHY to iterate, now learn HOW
- Promise: eight specific, actionable techniques
- Toolkit metaphor: each technique is a tool for a specific problem
- By the end, they'll have concrete phrases they can use immediately

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera, energized and ready to teach
- On-screen text: "The Refinement Toolkit: 8 Techniques"
- Brief graphic showing eight numbered icons or cards (preview of what's coming)

## Section 1: Simplify (0:45 - 2:15)

### Technique 1: Making Things Simpler

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique number one: Simplify. This is probably the one you'll use most often as a beginner. You ask Claude something, and the response comes back full of technical jargon or complex explanations. Instead of feeling lost, you just say: 'Can you simplify this? Explain it like I've never coded before.' Or even: 'Explain this like I'm five.' Claude will strip away the complexity and give you something you can actually understand."

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: response is too complex, uses jargon, feels overwhelming
- Example prompts: "Simplify this," "Explain like I'm five," "Use everyday language"
- This is the most beginner-friendly technique
- You're not admitting weakness; you're directing Claude to communicate better

**What to show on screen:**
- A Claude response with technical language
- The simplify follow-up prompt
- The simplified response side by side
- On-screen text: "Technique 1: SIMPLIFY"

### Quick Demo

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me show you. Say I asked Claude to explain how a website works, and it starts talking about HTTP requests, DNS resolution, and server-side rendering. I just reply: 'Can you explain this without any technical terms? Pretend I've never used a computer before.' And suddenly it's talking about how typing a web address is like mailing a letter to a specific house. Same information, completely different language."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Split screen: technical response vs. simplified response
- Highlight the jargon that disappeared
- On-screen text showing the follow-up prompt

---

## Section 2: Expand (2:15 - 3:30)

### Technique 2: Adding More Detail

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique two: Expand. This is the opposite of simplify. Sometimes Claude's response is too brief. It gives you the headline but skips the details. When that happens, you say: 'Can you add more detail about step three?' or 'Elaborate on the part about setting up the workspace.' You're telling Claude exactly where you need more information."

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: response is too brief, skips important details, feels incomplete
- Example prompts: "Add more detail about X," "Elaborate on Y," "What does step 3 actually involve?"
- Be specific about WHICH part needs expanding, not just "tell me more"
- This is especially useful when Claude gives a high-level overview but you need step-by-step instructions

**What to show on screen:**
- A brief Claude response
- The expand follow-up prompt
- The expanded response with new details highlighted
- On-screen text: "Technique 2: EXPAND"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "The key with expand is being specific. Don't just say 'Tell me more.' Say 'Tell me more about this specific part.' That way Claude knows exactly where to zoom in. It's like telling a photographer: don't just 'zoom in,' zoom in on the flowers in the bottom left corner."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Camera zoom analogy: wide shot narrowing to a specific detail
- On-screen text: "Be specific about WHAT to expand"

---

## Section 3: Restructure (3:30 - 4:45)

### Technique 3: Changing the Format

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique three: Restructure. This one is about format, not content. Claude gave you the right information, but in the wrong shape. Maybe it wrote paragraphs and you need a checklist. Maybe it gave you a list and you need a table. Restructure prompts sound like: 'Can you format this as a numbered step-by-step guide?' or 'Turn this into a table with columns for name, description, and when to use it.'"

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: right content, wrong format
- Example prompts: "Format as a table," "Break into numbered steps," "Rewrite as a FAQ," "Make this a checklist"
- Format changes can make the same content dramatically more useful
- Think about how you'll USE the output: that determines the best format

**What to show on screen:**
- A paragraph-style Claude response
- The restructure follow-up prompt
- The same content reformatted as a clean numbered list or table
- On-screen text: "Technique 3: RESTRUCTURE"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "I use this one all the time when building 02Ship. Claude would give me a description of how a feature should work in paragraph form, and I'd say: 'Can you restructure this as a checklist of requirements?' Same information, but now I can check things off as I build them. The format makes it actionable."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Before/after: paragraph vs. formatted checklist
- On-screen text: "Same content, better format"

---

## Section 4: Combine (4:45 - 5:45)

### Technique 4: Merging Ideas

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique four: Combine. Sometimes you ask Claude for help and it gives you multiple options. Option A is good for this reason, option B is good for that reason. But what you really want is the best of both. That's when you say: 'Can you combine the structure from option A with the tone from option B?' or 'Take the best parts of these three approaches and create one hybrid version.'"

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: you have multiple responses or options and want the best of each
- Example prompts: "Combine option A and B," "Create a hybrid," "Take the best parts of each"
- This works great after using the Alternative technique (Technique 7)
- You're being the creative director, picking what works from different options

**What to show on screen:**
- Two different Claude responses side by side
- The combine follow-up prompt
- The merged result with elements from both highlighted
- On-screen text: "Technique 4: COMBINE"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Think of it like ordering at a restaurant. You love the sauce from dish A and the protein from dish B. So you ask: can I get dish B with the sauce from dish A? You're customizing. And Claude is happy to mix and match."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Simple graphic: two options merging into one
- On-screen text: "Best of both worlds"

---

## Section 5: Constrain (5:45 - 7:00)

### Technique 5: Setting Boundaries

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique five: Constrain. This is for when Claude gives you too much. The response is three pages long when you needed three sentences. Or it includes advanced topics when you only wanted the basics. Constrain prompts set boundaries: 'Keep this under 100 words,' 'Focus only on the first step,' 'Remove anything a beginner wouldn't need to know.'"

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: response is too long, unfocused, or includes unnecessary complexity
- Example prompts: "Keep it under 100 words," "Focus only on X," "Remove technical jargon," "Just give me the beginner version"
- Constraints can be about length, scope, complexity, or audience
- This is the editing technique: cutting away what doesn't serve you

**What to show on screen:**
- A long, detailed Claude response
- The constrain follow-up prompt
- The shorter, focused result
- On-screen text: "Technique 5: CONSTRAIN"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "I think of this like editing a photo. The camera captured everything in the frame, but you crop it to focus on what matters. Constraining is cropping: you're telling Claude to remove the extra stuff and keep what's essential."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Photo cropping analogy: full frame narrowing to the focused subject
- On-screen text: "Cut what doesn't serve you"

---

## Section 6: Exemplify (7:00 - 8:15)

### Technique 6: Asking for Examples

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique six: Exemplify. This one is powerful. Claude explains a concept, and you understand it in theory, but you need to see it in practice. So you say: 'Can you show me a concrete example?' or 'Walk me through a real-world scenario' or 'Give me a code snippet that demonstrates this.' Examples turn abstract ideas into something tangible."

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: you understand the theory but need to see it in action
- Example prompts: "Show me an example," "Give me a code snippet," "Walk through a real scenario"
- Examples are how most people learn best
- This is especially useful for code: "Show me what this looks like in practice"

**What to show on screen:**
- A theoretical Claude response explaining a concept
- The exemplify follow-up prompt
- The response with a concrete, practical example
- On-screen text: "Technique 6: EXEMPLIFY"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "When I was building 02Ship, Claude would explain how routing works in Next.js, and I'd say: 'Can you show me what that looks like for a course page with a URL like /courses/claude-basics/lesson-1?' Suddenly the abstract concept became a real file I could create. That's the power of examples."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Before: abstract explanation. After: concrete example with real code
- On-screen text: "Theory + Example = Understanding"

---

## Section 7: Alternative (8:15 - 9:30)

### Technique 7: Exploring Other Options

**SCRIPT:**
> "Technique seven: Alternative. Sometimes Claude's first suggestion works, but you want to see what else is possible. Maybe it recommended one approach, but you're curious if there's a simpler option. You say: 'Give me three other ways to do this,' or 'What's a simpler alternative?' or 'Show me the pros and cons of different approaches.'"

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: the first suggestion doesn't feel right, or you want to compare options
- Example prompts: "Give me 3 alternatives," "What's a simpler way?", "Compare different approaches"
- Great for decision-making: see your options before committing
- Pairs well with Combine (Technique 4): get alternatives, then combine the best parts

**What to show on screen:**
- A single Claude suggestion
- The alternative follow-up prompt
- Multiple options with brief descriptions
- On-screen text: "Technique 7: ALTERNATIVE"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "This is like shopping. You don't buy the first jacket you try on. You want to see a few options, compare them, and then pick the one that fits best. Or sometimes, you take the color from jacket A and the style from jacket B and find jacket C that has both. That's Alternative plus Combine working together."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Shopping analogy: three options side by side
- On-screen text: "See your options before you commit"
- Arrow connecting Alternative to Combine technique (chaining)

---

## Section 8: Critique (9:30 - 10:45)

### Technique 8: Self-Evaluation

**SCRIPT:**
> "And technique eight: Critique. This is my favorite, and honestly the one that surprised me the most. You can ask Claude to critique its own work. Yes, really. You say: 'What are the weaknesses of this approach?' or 'Play devil's advocate: why might this not work?' or 'Review this for potential problems.' Claude will honestly point out limitations, edge cases, and things you might not have considered."

**Keypoints:**
- When to use: you want to validate quality, or you're not sure if the response is good enough
- Example prompts: "What's wrong with this?", "Critique your own answer," "What am I missing?", "Point out the weaknesses"
- Claude is genuinely good at self-evaluation and finding gaps
- This builds your judgment: over time, you'll spot issues before needing to ask

**What to show on screen:**
- A Claude response that looks complete
- The critique follow-up prompt
- Claude identifying weaknesses and suggesting improvements
- On-screen text: "Technique 8: CRITIQUE"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "When I'm working on 02Ship, after Claude generates a feature, I'll often say: 'What could go wrong with this? What did we miss?' And Claude will point out things like 'This doesn't handle the case where a lesson has no video yet' or 'You might want to add error handling here.' It's like having a second pair of eyes reviewing your work."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show Claude identifying specific issues in its own work
- On-screen text: "Your built-in quality checker"

---

## Section 9: Chaining Techniques and Knowing When to Use Each (10:45 - 12:30)

### Chaining: Using Techniques Together

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now here's where it gets fun. You can chain these techniques together in a single follow-up. You can say: 'Can you simplify this AND give me an example?' or 'Give me three alternatives, then combine the best parts into one.' Chaining is natural and Claude handles it well. You don't need to use one technique per message."

**Keypoints:**
- Techniques can be combined in a single follow-up prompt
- Common chains: Simplify + Exemplify, Alternative + Combine, Expand + Restructure
- Keep it to two or three techniques per follow-up for clarity
- The phrase "Can you..." is your friend: Claude responds well to polite, specific requests

**Visual suggestions:**
- Graphic: technique cards being stacked or linked together
- On-screen text: "Chain techniques: Simplify + Example in one prompt"
- Show an example of a chained follow-up prompt

### The Quick Reference Guide

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me give you a quick cheat sheet for knowing which technique to reach for. If the response is too complicated: Simplify. Too short: Expand. Right info, wrong format: Restructure. Want to merge ideas: Combine. Too long or unfocused: Constrain. Need to see it in action: Exemplify. Want more options: Alternative. Not sure if it's good: Critique."

**Keypoints:**
- Too complicated -> Simplify
- Too short -> Expand
- Wrong format -> Restructure
- Want to merge -> Combine
- Too long -> Constrain
- Need an example -> Exemplify
- Want options -> Alternative
- Need validation -> Critique

**What to show on screen:**
- A clear, readable reference card with all eight techniques
- Problem on the left, technique on the right
- On-screen text: "Your Refinement Cheat Sheet"

### These Work for Everything

**SCRIPT:**
> "One more thing: these techniques work for any kind of output. Code, writing, brainstorming, analysis, planning, anything. If Claude generates code and it's too complex, you simplify. If Claude writes a blog post and it's too short, you expand. If Claude gives you a project plan and you want to see alternatives, you ask for them. The techniques are universal."

**Keypoints:**
- These eight techniques work for any Claude output: code, text, ideas, analysis, plans
- The toolkit is universal, not limited to one type of task
- As they build projects with 02Ship, they'll use all eight naturally
- Reinforce that these are professional-level skills

**Visual suggestions:**
- Icons representing different output types: code, text, ideas, plans
- On-screen text: "Works for code, writing, ideas, plans, anything"

## Closing (12:30 - 14:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's do a quick recap of your eight refinement techniques. One: Simplify, make it easier to understand. Two: Expand, add more detail. Three: Restructure, change the format. Four: Combine, merge the best ideas. Five: Constrain, set boundaries and focus. Six: Exemplify, show concrete examples. Seven: Alternative, explore other options. Eight: Critique, find the weaknesses.
>
> These eight moves will cover about 95% of the follow-ups you'll ever need. And remember, you can chain them together: 'Simplify AND give me an example.' The phrase 'Can you...' is your best friend when working with Claude.
>
> In the next video, we'll put this all together. I'll show you how conversations flow, how Claude's memory works within a conversation, and we'll do a live demo where we refine a piece of code from rough draft to production-ready in just four steps. You'll see these techniques in action, one after another, building toward a polished final result.
>
> See you in Video 3!"

**Keypoints:**
- Quick recap of all eight techniques by name
- Reinforce chaining and the "Can you..." phrase
- Tease Video 3: conversation flow, memory, and a live code refinement demo
- Keep energy high and encouraging

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the eight-technique reference card one more time
- On-screen text recap of all eight techniques
- On-screen text: "Next: Conversation Flow & Live Demo"
- End card with links to next video and Discord

## Key Talking Points Summary

**Essential messages to hit:**

1. **Each technique solves a specific problem** (know the problem, pick the right tool)
2. **You can chain techniques together** (Simplify + Exemplify in one follow-up)
3. **"Can you..." is your friend** (polite, specific requests get the best results from Claude)
4. **These work for any output type** (code, text, ideas, analysis, plans)
5. **The cheat sheet is your go-to reference** (problem on the left, technique on the right)
6. **You don't need to memorize all eight today** (start with Simplify, Expand, and Critique; add others as needed)

---

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- **Practical and actionable** (every technique comes with exact phrases to use)
- **Well-paced** (eight techniques is a lot; keep each one crisp and example-driven)
- **Empowering** (after this video, they have a complete toolkit)
- **Structured clearly** (viewers should feel organized, not overwhelmed)

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "Do I need to memorize all eight?" → No, start with Simplify and Expand, add others naturally
- "What if I use the wrong technique?" → There's no wrong choice; Claude will work with any follow-up
- "Can I combine techniques?" → Absolutely, that's encouraged
- "What if Claude still doesn't get it after using a technique?" → Try a different technique, or be more specific about what's wrong

### Things to Avoid
- Spending too long on any single technique (keep each to 60-90 seconds)
- Making the techniques feel like rules to memorize (they're tools to reach for)
- Using only abstract examples (every technique needs a concrete before/after)
- Rushing through the chaining section (this is where the real power is)
- Overwhelming beginners (remind them: start with 2-3 techniques, add more over time)
