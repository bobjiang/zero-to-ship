---

## Opening (0:00 - 1:00)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "What if you could research an entire market, analyze competitors, and have a report ready to guide your product decisions -- all in under ten minutes? Before AI, this kind of research was something you'd hire a consultant for or spend days doing yourself. In this video, I'm going to show you how to turn Claude into your personal research assistant. And I don't mean just asking it random questions -- I mean a structured research workflow that gives you real insights you can act on. Whether you're validating a product idea, scoping out competitors, or trying to understand what your users actually want, this process works."

**Keypoints:**
- Open with the time-saving hook -- research in minutes, not days
- Establish that this is a professional skill, not just a tech trick
- Preview the four-phase research workflow they'll learn
- Connect to product building: research informs every decision

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera (enthusiastic, setting up a discovery moment)
- On-screen text: "Research in Minutes, Not Days"
- Brief flash of a before/after: a pile of articles vs. a clean research summary

## Section 1: Why Research Matters for Product Building (1:00 - 2:30)

### Research Is Not Optional

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me be honest with you: one of the biggest mistakes people make when building a product is skipping research. They have an idea, they get excited, and they jump straight into building. Then three months later, they discover someone already built the exact same thing. Or worse -- nobody actually wants what they built."

**Keypoints:**
- Research prevents wasted time and effort
- Understanding your market, users, and competitors is not a 'nice to have' -- it is essential
- You do not need to be a 'researcher' to do good research
- Claude makes this accessible to everyone, regardless of background

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Good research answers four critical questions: Who are my users? What do they actually need? Who else is solving this problem? And what makes my approach different? When I was building 02Ship, I spent time researching other learning platforms -- what they did well, where they fell short, and what gap existed for absolute beginners. That research shaped every major decision about the platform."

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen text showing the four questions as bullet points
- Show a brief example of the 02Ship competitive landscape (simplified)
- Keep this section conversational, not lecture-like

## Section 2: Claude's Research Superpowers (2:30 - 4:00)

### What Makes Claude Different from Google

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now, you might be thinking, 'I can just Google things.' And yes, you can. But here's the difference: Google gives you a list of links. Claude gives you understanding. Google says, 'here are ten articles about market size.' Claude says, 'here's what those articles mean for your specific product idea, and here's what you should do about it.'"

**Keypoints:**
- Claude's three research superpowers: speed, synthesis, and pattern-finding
- Speed: analyze multiple sources in seconds
- Synthesis: connect ideas across different sources into a coherent picture
- Pattern-finding: spot themes, contradictions, and gaps you might miss

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "There's an important word here: synthesis. Summarizing means shrinking something down -- making it shorter. Synthesizing means connecting things together -- finding the story across multiple sources. That's Claude's real superpower. You paste in five different articles, and Claude doesn't just tell you what each one says. It tells you what they mean together."

**What to show on screen:**
- Side-by-side: 'Summary' vs. 'Synthesis' with simple definitions
- On-screen text: "Summarize = make shorter. Synthesize = connect the dots."
- Visual of multiple sources flowing into one coherent insight

---

## Section 3: The Four-Phase Research Workflow (4:00 - 6:00)

### Gather, Summarize, Synthesize, Insights

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's the workflow I use every time I research something with Claude. It has four phases: gather, summarize, synthesize, and extract insights. Let me walk you through each one."

#### Phase 1: Gather Sources (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Phase one is gathering. This is the part you do yourself. Find three to five articles, reports, blog posts, or data sources about your topic. You can use Google, industry blogs, Reddit threads -- whatever is relevant. Now here's the critical thing to understand: Claude cannot browse the internet. It can't go look things up for you. So you need to copy and paste the relevant content into your conversation. Don't paste entire articles -- grab the key paragraphs, the important data, the relevant sections."

**Keypoints:**
- Find 3-5 relevant sources manually (Google, blogs, reports)
- Claude cannot browse the web -- you must paste content in
- Copy key sections, not entire articles
- Provide context: tell Claude what you are researching and why

#### Phase 2: Summarize (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Phase two: ask Claude to summarize each source. A good prompt here is: 'Summarize each of these sources in three to five bullet points, focusing on user adoption trends.' Notice how I'm telling Claude what to focus on. That focus makes the summaries useful instead of generic."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask Claude to summarize each source separately
- Direct its focus: "focusing on [specific aspect]"
- This gives you the key points from each source quickly

#### Phase 3: Synthesize (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Phase three is where the magic happens. You say to Claude: 'Now synthesize these summaries. What are the common themes? Where do the sources disagree? What's missing?' This is where Claude connects the dots. It finds patterns across your sources that you might not have spotted on your own."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask Claude to find common themes, disagreements, and gaps
- This is where Claude's pattern-finding shines
- You get a unified picture instead of separate summaries

#### Phase 4: Extract Insights (30 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Phase four: extract actionable insights. Ask Claude: 'Based on this research, what are the top three insights for someone building a learning platform for beginners? What should I do next?' Notice how I'm asking for action -- not just understanding, but 'what should I do about it?' That's what makes research useful."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask for actionable takeaways, not just analysis
- Frame it around your specific product or decision
- Ask "what should I do next?" to get practical recommendations

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the four phases as a horizontal flow diagram on screen
- Each phase has a label: Gather, Summarize, Synthesize, Insights
- On-screen text highlighting the key prompt for each phase

## Section 4: Research Prompts for Different Situations (6:00 - 7:30)

### Market, Competitor, User, and Technical Research

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now let me give you specific prompts for the four types of research you'll do most often when building a product."

#### Market Research (20 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "For market research, try this: 'I'm building a learning platform for non-programmers. Based on these articles about the online education market, what's the market size, who are the main players, and what trends should I pay attention to?' You're asking Claude to interpret data through the lens of your specific product."

**Keypoints:**
- Focus on market size, trends, and opportunities
- Always frame it around your specific product idea

#### Competitor Research (20 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "For competitor research: 'Here are descriptions of five competing platforms. Create a comparison table showing their pricing, key features, target audience, strengths, and weaknesses. Then tell me where the gap is.' Claude loves creating comparison tables -- and they're incredibly useful for spotting opportunities."

**Keypoints:**
- Ask for comparison tables (Claude excels at this)
- Include specific comparison dimensions
- Ask it to identify gaps and opportunities

#### User Research (20 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "For user research: 'Here are forum posts and Reddit threads from people trying to learn coding. What are their top frustrations? What do they wish existed? What language do they use to describe their problems?' That last question is gold -- understanding how your users talk about their problems helps you market to them later."

**Keypoints:**
- Paste real user conversations (forums, Reddit, reviews)
- Ask for frustrations, wishes, and the exact language users use
- User language becomes your marketing language later

#### Technical Research (20 seconds)

**SCRIPT:**
> "And for technical research: 'I'm considering using Next.js for my project. Based on these articles, what are the pros and cons for a beginner-focused learning platform? What alternatives should I consider?' Even if you're not technical, Claude helps you make informed technology decisions."

**Keypoints:**
- Claude can help evaluate technology choices you don't fully understand
- Ask for pros, cons, and alternatives
- Frame it around your specific use case and audience

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show each research type as a card or panel on screen
- Display the key prompt for each type
- On-screen text: "Four Types of Research"

## Section 5: Live Demo -- Researching a Product Idea in 10 Minutes (7:30 - 11:00)

### Real-Time Research Workflow

**SCRIPT:**
> "Alright, let's put this into practice. I'm going to research a product idea from scratch, live, using the four-phase workflow. Let's say I'm exploring the idea for 02Ship -- a learning platform for non-programmers. I'll walk you through exactly what I'd do."

#### Step 1: Gathering Sources (7:30 - 8:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "First, I gathered a few sources. I found articles about the state of online education, a report on AI coding tools adoption, a few Reddit threads where beginners talked about their frustrations learning to code, and a comparison post about existing platforms. Let me paste these into Claude."

**What to show on screen:**
- Open Claude interface
- Paste in 2-3 pre-prepared source excerpts
- Show the prompt: "I'm researching the market for a learning platform that helps non-programmers build apps using AI tools like Claude. Here are several sources I've gathered. Please help me analyze them."
- Type naturally, not too fast

#### Step 2: Summarize (8:00 - 8:45)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now I'll ask Claude to summarize: 'Summarize each source in three to five bullet points, focusing on what this means for someone building a learning platform for beginners.'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the summarize prompt
- Show Claude's response appearing
- Briefly read through a few bullet points aloud
- Point out how Claude focused on the relevant angle

#### Step 3: Synthesize (8:45 - 9:30)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's the synthesis step -- this is where it gets interesting. I'll ask: 'Now synthesize these summaries. What are the common themes? Where do sources disagree? What's missing from the current landscape?'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the synthesis prompt
- Show Claude identifying themes and patterns
- Highlight a particularly insightful connection Claude makes
- Point out any contradictions or gaps Claude finds

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Look at that -- Claude just identified that most platforms assume coding knowledge, but there's a growing audience of non-technical people who want to build things. That's the gap. That's the insight that says '02Ship should exist.'"

#### Step 4: Extract Insights (9:30 - 10:15)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Final step: 'Based on this research, what are the top three insights for someone building this platform? What should I prioritize, and what should I avoid?'"

**What to show on screen:**
- Send the insights prompt
- Show Claude's actionable recommendations
- Read through the top insights
- React authentically: "That's a great point" or "I hadn't thought of that"

#### Step 5: Wrap-up (10:15 - 11:00)

**SCRIPT:**
> "And there it is. In about ten minutes, we went from a rough idea to a research-backed understanding of the market, the competition, the user needs, and what to prioritize. This is the kind of research that used to take days. Now, one important caveat: always verify key facts. Claude's knowledge has a cutoff date, and it can sometimes get specific numbers or dates wrong. Use Claude for patterns and insights, then spot-check the critical facts yourself."

**Keypoints:**
- Emphasize the speed: real insights in minutes
- Remind viewers to verify key facts and figures
- Claude is best for patterns and synthesis, not for precise data points
- Save the research output to your workspace for future reference

**Visual suggestions:**
- Full-screen Claude interface throughout the demo
- Keep pacing steady -- do not rush
- Highlight key insights as they appear with on-screen annotations
- Show saving the output to the workspace folder at the end

## Closing (11:00 - 12:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let's recap. You now have a four-phase research workflow: gather your sources, have Claude summarize them, ask Claude to synthesize and find patterns, then extract actionable insights. You've got specific prompts for market research, competitor analysis, user research, and technical research. And you saw it all come together in a live demo.
>
> The key takeaway: ask Claude to synthesize, not just summarize. That's the difference between getting a shorter version of what you already read and getting genuine new understanding.
>
> In the next video, we're going to take this further. I'll show you how to analyze actual data -- survey results, spreadsheet numbers, user feedback -- even if you've never touched a statistics course in your life. You don't need to be a data analyst. You just need the right questions.
>
> See you there!"

**Keypoints:**
- Recap the four-phase workflow
- Reinforce the key distinction: synthesize vs. summarize
- Tease Video 2 (data analysis) to maintain momentum
- Keep energy encouraging and practical

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show your face (confident, encouraging)
- On-screen text: "Synthesize, Don't Just Summarize"
- End card with link to next video and course page

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- Practical and empowering -- this is a professional skill anyone can learn
- Conversational but structured -- the four-phase workflow provides a clear backbone
- Show genuine discovery during the live demo -- react naturally to Claude's insights
- Use 02Ship as the running example to keep things concrete and relatable

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "Can Claude just look things up for me?" --> No, Claude cannot browse the web. You paste in the content, and Claude analyzes it
- "How do I know if Claude's research is accurate?" --> Verify key facts yourself. Use Claude for patterns and synthesis, then spot-check numbers and dates
- "I don't know where to find good sources" --> Start with Google, industry blogs, Reddit, product review sites. Even three sources is enough to start
- "This seems like a lot of work" --> The workflow takes ten minutes once you have your sources. Finding sources takes another ten. Twenty minutes for real insights is incredibly fast

### Things to Avoid
- Making research sound academic or intimidating
- Implying Claude's research output is always accurate (always verify)
- Glossing over the "gather" phase -- viewers need to understand Claude cannot search the web
- Using jargon like "primary research" or "secondary research" without explanation
- Rushing through the live demo (viewers need to absorb each phase)
