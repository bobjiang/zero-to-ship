SIMPLIFY**\nWhen to use: Output is too complex, uses jargon, or feels overwhelming.\nPrompts:\n- 'Simplify this for someone who's never coded before'\n- 'Explain this using everyday language'\n- 'Remove the technical terms and use analogies'\n\n**2. EXPAND**\nWhen to use: Output is too brief, lacks detail, or skips important parts.\nPrompts:\n- 'Add more detail about how [specific part] works'\n- 'Elaborate on step 3 — what exactly do I do?'\n- 'Provide more context about when to use this'\n\n**3. RESTRUCTURE**\nWhen to use: Right content, wrong format.\nPrompts:\n- 'Format this as a table with columns: [X, Y, Z]'\n- 'Break this into numbered steps'\n- 'Organize this as a bulleted list by category'\n- 'Rewrite this as a FAQ'\n\n**4. COMBINE**\nWhen to use: Multiple responses that need merging.\nPrompts:\n- 'Combine your first answer and second answer into one cohesive response'\n- 'Take the best parts of these 3 options and create a hybrid'\n\n**5. CONSTRAIN**\nWhen to use: Output is too long, unfocused, or includes unnecessary parts.\nPrompts:\n- 'Keep this under 100 words'\n- 'Focus only on the [specific aspect], remove the rest'\n- 'Remove anything not essential for beginners'\n\n**6. EXEMPLIFY**\nWhen to use: Theory without practice, or you need to see it in action.\nPrompts:\n- 'Show me a concrete example of this'\n- 'Give me code that demonstrates this concept'\n- 'Walk through a real-world scenario'\n\n**7. ALTERNATIVE**\nWhen to use: You want options, or the first suggestion doesn't feel right.\nPrompts:\n- 'Give me 3 other ways to approach this'\n- 'What's a simpler alternative to this solution?'\n- 'Show me the pros and cons of different approaches'\n\n**8. CRITIQUE**\nWhen to use: You want Claude to self-evaluate or identify weaknesses.\nPrompts:\n- 'What are the limitations of this approach?'\n- 'Critique your own answer — what's missing?'\n- 'Play devil's advocate: why might this not work?'\n- 'Review this code for potential bugs or edge cases'"

Review what worked and what didn't in the previous attempt\n2. Write a new, more specific prompt incorporating lessons learned\n3. Optionally: Start a new conversation to clear context\n4. Reference the old attempt if helpful: 'Previously you suggested X, but I actually need Y'\n\n**Pro tip:** Keep a 'drafts' document where you paste iterations.

    "This lesson is standalone — no dependency on previous lessons. If students haven't done Lesson 2, do a 2-minute recap of good prompting basics.",
    "For live sessions: Pair students up and have them iterate on each other's prompts. Seeing someone else refine teaches faster than solo work.",
    "Common question: 'How many iterations is too many?' Answer: If you're past 3-4, the problem is usually the initial prompt or unclear goal.",
    "Self-paced tip: Encourage students to share their best before/afters in Discord — seeing peer improvements motivates.",
    "Time check: Exercise 3 is open-ended and can run long if students pick complex tasks. Suggest time-boxing to 60 minutes.",
    "Bonus activity: 'Iteration race' — who can get from vague to excellent in fewest iterations?",
    "Key insight to emphasize: Iteration is a superpower. Humans draft and redraft constantly — now you can do it collaboratively with AI.",
    "Note: Students may feel 'dumb' for needing iteration. Normalize it! Show examples of professional AI users iterating 5+ times."
