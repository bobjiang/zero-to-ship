**Target Duration:** 8 minutes
**Max Duration:** 15 minutes
**Target Audience:** Absolute beginners with no coding experience

## Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

### Hook & Introduction

**SCRIPT:**
> "Before we can start building anything, we need to get your workspace ready. The good news? You only need one thing to get started today: a Claude account. In this video, I'll walk you through everything—from creating your account to organizing your workspace to keeping yourself safe when working with AI-generated code."

**Keypoints:**
- Reassure viewers: setup is simple
- Set expectations: one account is all they need right now
- Preview the three sections: account, workspace, safety

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show yourself on camera (friendly, casual)
- On-screen text: "Setup Checklist"
- Brief flash of the Claude.ai login page

## Section 1: Create Your Claude Account (0:30 - 2:30)

### Account Setup Walkthrough

**SCRIPT:**
> "Step one: let's get you a Claude account. Head to claude.ai—I'll put the link in the description—and click 'Sign Up.' You can sign up with your email or Google account. It's free to start."

**Keypoints:**
- Go to claude.ai
- Sign up with email or Google account
- Free tier is sufficient for this course
- Walk through the sign-up flow step by step

**What to show on screen:**
- Navigate to claude.ai
- Click through the sign-up process
- Show the main Claude interface once logged in
- Point out key areas: conversation input, new chat button

### Claude Pro (Optional Upgrade)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now, there's an optional upgrade called Claude Pro. It gives you more messages per day and access to the latest models. For this course, the free plan works fine—but if you find yourself hitting message limits during exercises, Pro is worth considering. Don't worry about it now; you can always upgrade later."

**Keypoints:**
- Claude Pro gives extended usage and latest models
- Free plan is enough to start
- Upgrade later if needed—no pressure
- Don't let cost be a barrier to starting

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the pricing page briefly
- On-screen text: "Free plan = enough to start"
- Highlight that this is optional

---

## Section 2: Workspace Setup (2:30 - 5:00)

### Creating Your Project Folder Structure

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now that you have your account, let's set up a simple workspace on your computer. This is just a folder where you'll save your prompts, Claude's responses, and any files you create. Think of it like setting up a desk before you start working."

**Keypoints:**
- Create a main project folder (e.g., `my-ai-projects`)
- Inside it, create three subfolders:
  - `/prompts` — where you save your prompts
  - `/outputs` — where you save Claude's responses
  - `/projects` — where your actual project files will go
- Use whatever tool you're comfortable with (Finder, File Explorer, etc.)

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "Here's what I recommend: create a folder called 'my-ai-projects' somewhere easy to find—your Desktop or Documents folder works great. Inside that, make three folders: 'prompts,' 'outputs,' and 'projects.' That's it. Prompts is where you save what you type into Claude. Outputs is where you save what Claude gives back. And projects is where your actual apps will live."

**What to show on screen:**
- Create the folder structure live on screen
- Show it in Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)
- On-screen text showing the folder tree:
  ```
  my-ai-projects/
  ├── prompts/
  ├── outputs/
  └── projects/
  ```

### Saving Your Work

**SCRIPT:**
> "One quick tip: get into the habit of saving your prompts. Copy and paste them into a text file before you send them to Claude. This way, if a prompt works really well, you can reuse it later. I still have the original prompts I used to build 02Ship."

**Keypoints:**
- Save prompts as text files (`.txt` or `.md`)
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `landing-page-prompt-v1.txt`)
- Save Claude's responses too, especially good ones
- This becomes your personal prompt library over time

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show creating a sample text file
- Show a naming convention example
- On-screen text: "Save your prompts — future you will thank you"

## Section 3: Safety Basics (5:00 - 7:30)

### The Golden Rule

**SCRIPT:**
> "Alright, the most important part of this video: safety. When you're working with AI-generated code, there's one golden rule I want you to remember: always read what Claude generates before you run it."

**Keypoints:**
- Always read code before running it
- You don't need to understand every line
- Look for things that seem off: file deletions, network requests to unknown places, requests for passwords
- When in doubt, ask Claude to explain what the code does

**Visual suggestions:**
- On-screen text (large): "Read before you run"
- Show an example of reviewing code briefly

### API Keys and Sensitive Information

**SCRIPT:**
> "Second safety rule: never share your API keys or passwords with anyone, and never paste them into public places. An API key is like a password for a service—if someone gets it, they can use your account and potentially charge you money."

**Keypoints:**
- API keys = passwords for services
- Never share them publicly (GitHub, forums, screenshots)
- Never paste them into Claude conversations (Claude doesn't need your passwords)
- If you accidentally share one, revoke it immediately and create a new one

**What to emphasize:**
> "If Claude ever asks you for a password or API key, something is wrong. Claude doesn't need your passwords to help you."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show an example of what an API key looks like (redacted)
- On-screen text: "Never share API keys"
- Show where to find API key settings (e.g., in a service dashboard)

### Basic Code Review Checklist

**SCRIPT:**
> "I know you might be thinking, 'How can I review code if I don't know how to code?' Fair question. Here's a simple checklist for beginners:"

**Keypoints — checklist to show on screen:**
1. Does Claude's explanation match what you asked for?
2. Are there any file operations you didn't request? (deleting files, accessing system folders)
3. Does the code reference external websites or services you didn't mention?
4. When in doubt, ask Claude: "Can you explain what this code does step by step?"

**SCRIPT (continued):**
> "You don't need to be a security expert. Just use common sense. If you asked for a calculator app and Claude's code is trying to access your email, that's a red flag. In practice, this almost never happens—Claude is designed to be helpful and safe—but it's a good habit to build from day one."

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show the checklist as on-screen graphics
- Keep it simple and non-intimidating
- On-screen text: "When in doubt, ask Claude to explain"

## Closing (7:30 - 8:00)

### Recap & Next Steps

**SCRIPT:**
> "That's your setup complete! Let's recap: you've got your Claude account, your workspace is organized, and you know the safety basics—read before you run, protect your keys, and ask Claude to explain anything you don't understand.
>
> In the next video, we get to the fun part: writing your first build prompt. I'll show you the exact prompt structure that works, and we'll use the 02Ship platform as our real-world example. You'll go from an idea to a starter app plan in one conversation.
>
> See you in Video 3!"

**Keypoints:**
- Quick recap of the three sections
- Tease the exciting next video (first real prompt!)
- Keep energy encouraging

**Visual suggestions:**
- Show your face (enthusiastic, welcoming)
- On-screen text: "Next: Your First Build Prompt"
- End card with links

## Key Talking Points Summary

**Essential messages to hit:**

1. **Setup is simple** (one account, three folders, basic safety habits)
2. **Free plan is enough** (don't let cost be a barrier)
3. **Save your prompts** (build a personal prompt library)
4. **Read before you run** (golden rule of AI-generated code)
5. **Never share API keys** (treat them like passwords)
6. **Ask Claude to explain** (you don't need to be a code expert to stay safe)

## Production Notes

### Tone & Style
- **Practical and reassuring** (this is easy, you can do this)
- **Step-by-step** (show every click, don't skip steps)
- **Non-intimidating** (safety section should inform, not scare)
- **Encouraging** (they're almost ready to start building!)

### Common Beginner Concerns to Address
- "Do I need to pay?" → No, free plan works fine for now
- "I'm not technical enough to review code" → Use the checklist; ask Claude to explain
- "What if I mess up the folder structure?" → It's just folders; you can reorganize anytime
- "Is AI-generated code dangerous?" → Generally safe, but good habits matter

### Things to Avoid
- Making setup sound complicated (it's three steps)
- Dwelling too long on safety (inform but don't frighten)
- Skipping steps in the screen recording (beginners need to see every click)
- Assuming familiarity with terms like "API key" without explaining
