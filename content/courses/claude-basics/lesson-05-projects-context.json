      "title": "Conversation Organization Best Practices",
      "content": "**Naming Conversations:**\n\n✅ Good:\n- 'Build user profile page'\n- 'Debug Stripe payment integration'\n- 'Add dark mode toggle'\n- 'Refactor auth flow'\n\n❌ Bad:\n- 'Help' (too vague)\n- 'Untitled' (default, always rename!)\n- 'Fix' (fix what?)\n- '12/25 work' (use descriptive names, not dates)\n\n**When to Start a New Conversation:**\n- Beginning a distinct feature or task\n- Previous conversation exceeded 50+ messages (gets unwieldy)\n- Switching to different part of the codebase\n- Starting a new sprint or development phase\n\n**When to Continue Existing Conversation:**\n- Iterating on the same feature\n- Debugging issues from the same work session\n- Following up on a question from earlier\n- Making related changes to what you just built\n\n**Archiving Strategy:**\n1. After a feature ships → archive that conversation\n2. After a major refactor → archive old implementation discussions\n3. Monthly cleanup → archive anything older than 30 days you won't reference\n4. Keep important decision logs even if old (tag them clearly)\n\n**Referencing Previous Conversations:**\nClaude can reference past conversations within a Project:\n- 'In our conversation about the login flow, you suggested...'\n- 'Remember the dark mode feature we built last week?'\n- 'Update the header component we created in the previous conversation'\n\nThis works because Projects maintain full history!"
